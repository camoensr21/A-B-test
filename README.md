# A-B-test
We have two groups : control and treatment, control is the group of users who used to use the old page, while treatment are the ones 
who did not use the old_page. Both group are exposed to the two landing_page. The objective is to set up some rules to decide which one of 
the landing_page the company should implement or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. 
To decide, we will refer to the proportion of unique users visiting each page and decide to pay for the company's product. 
In this first section We are looking for the following information:
-The number of unique users in the dataset
-The number of unique users by group
-The proportion of users converted
-The number of time the new_page and treatment don't match
-The proportion of control group who convert on old_page
-The proportion of treatment group who convert on old_page
-The proportion of control group who convert on new_page
-The proportion of treatment group who convert on new_page

In this project we will use some key statistics concepts such as: Binomial, Bayes rules diagram, Maximum probability,confidence intervall, Central Limit 
Theorem,Practical Statistics vs Significance, Hypothesis testing,Ordinary Least Square regression , logistic regression.
